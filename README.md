This project analyzes U.S. military research investments in autonomy and AI, using publicly available budgetary data on the Department of Defense science and technology program, and more specifically, funds allocated to basic, applied, and advanced research by the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force and DARPA in FY2020. The code searches AI and autonomy related key words from the Project Element (PE), Program, and Component level descriptions, and calculates the aggregated statistics of the autonomy and AI related initiatives.

The code searches AI related keywords from the military PE, project, and component descriptions and calculates the aggregated statistics of the AI-related projects. Raw data on the project desriptions and expenditure is MASTER.csv. The raw data and aggregated tables are saved at CSET Google Cloud Storage space: gs://cset_financial_data/LAWS. The access to raw data is requried to run the code.
